Hi, I'm Ege.

I'm currently working at Percona on Kubernetes operators for MySQL, MongoDB
and PostgreSQL, helping teams run open source databases on Kubernetes. All the
work we do in Percona is open source and available [on GitHub](https://github.com/percona/).

I got into programming by my fascination with Linux. I like minimalist setups and
having a toolbox of CLI tools/scripts of my own. I [default to
open](https://github.com/egegunes) everything I build.

I mostly write Go for the operators, but I've shipped plenty of PHP, Python and
JavaScript in production. I don't have rigid preferences when it comes to
technology stack.

I enjoy listening others' stories and telling mine. If you have a story to
tell, write to me at `egegunes at gmail dot com`.
