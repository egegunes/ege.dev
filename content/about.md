Hi, I'm Ege.

I'm a software engineer. Currently working on Kubernetes operators for
Percona database distributions.

My enthusiasm for computers initiated by the admiration to \*nix and it's
hacker culture. I like minimalist setups and having a toolbox of my own. I
[default to open](https://github.com/egegunes) everything I build.

I use Go in my day-to-day work. I extensively used Python/Django to put
things in production and it's still my default choice to GET THINGS DONE. I
don't have rigid preferences when it comes to technology stack.

I enjoy listening other's stories and telling mine. If you have a story to
tell, write to me at `ege at gmail.com`
