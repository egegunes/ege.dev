A fucking Django bug took more than 2h!! It was a fucking Wagtail admin site bug. If you use `InlinePanel` with an `Orderable` and use `min_num=1` to have the first form open on page load, you'll see an input named `ORDER` without a value in the form. Why it's important? Because Django uses this field to order formsets and django-modelcluster depends on this ordering to make the data `Orderable` with `sort_order` field and Wagtail uses django-modelcluster. Solution? Using `min_num=0`. Fuck.
