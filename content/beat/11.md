I spent 3h working on my notes last 4 days. I read about
[LYT](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/_Start+Here) and start mapping my
content.

It led to the idea about a new kind of output I might enjoy writing: Maps. Map
is a both high level look at subject and something can reader zoom in to see
the branches. It's like an isolated Wikipedia page but the path is arranged by
the mapmaker, not the collective consensus. There are three maps that I'm
already excited about:

1. Map of Carl Jung
2. Ismet Ozel haritasi
3. Pir Sultan haritasi
