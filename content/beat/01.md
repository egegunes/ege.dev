I like direct feedback whether is positive or negative.

I created [egegunes.rocks](https://egegunes.rocks) for that. It's a litte web
application to allow people provide anonymous feedback about me.

It was also a opportunity to continue my [serverless
journey](https://ege.dev/post/running-python-on-aws-lambda/). It's running on
AWS Lambda and stores its data in AWS DynamoDB.

You can see the [source](https://github.com/egegunes/egegunes.rocks) on Github.
