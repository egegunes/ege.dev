There is a new paranoid lawyer bot in town!

[LicenseBot](https://twitter.com/license_bot) is the idea of [Akın
Ömeroğlu](https://twitter.com/akinomeroglu). Basically, it monitors public
events from Github and analyzes commits for license changes. If it founds one,
tweets it.

Also, it's my first Go project. You can see the
[source](https://github.com/egegunes/LicenseBot) on Github.

2019-02-20 UPDATE: I shut down the service because my GCP trial has ended.
Cloud is expensive.
