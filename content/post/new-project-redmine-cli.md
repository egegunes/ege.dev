I'm happy to announce my latest project [Redmine
CLI](https://github.com/egegunes/redmine-cli) is available. It's a command line
interface for the project management and bug tracking software called
[Redmine](https://www.redmine.org) that we use in
[Artistanbul](https://artistanbul.io).

You can install it via `pip`:

```
$ pip3 install --user redminecli
```

Also, I'm planning to make a RPM package for Fedora, so you will be able to
install it with `dnf` in the near future.

To see examples of how to use `redmine` see the
[README](https://github.com/egegunes/redmine-cli/blob/master/README.md).
