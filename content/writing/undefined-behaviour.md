robotic voice announces  
the stop we left was the last one on our roadmap  
and now  
we're entering the uncharted territory  

did I miss my last chance to get off  
but I didn't want to stop, didn't like the last station  
I want to move forward  
but not continuously on the same train  

I get up and press the telecom button  
"greetings, when will the train stop?"  
robotic voice responds "it's undefined behavior"  
what does it mean?  
it means you may get different answers on each time you ask  

when will the train stop?  
never
