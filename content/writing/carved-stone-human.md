_Translated by Claude 3.5 Sonnet. You can read the original [here](/writing/yontma-das-insan/)._

Modern humans live in an age of carved marble. Now, both the carved and the carver are ourselves, replacing the statues of old. Like a sculptor revealing the statue within the stone, we keep hammering away at ourselves, hoping to find our authentic self.

We carve ourselves to fit within the boundaries of what's reasonable. In the name of not being different, or rather not being the one who's not different, we try to smooth out our rough edges. Everyone has turned into sheep trying to distinguish themselves from the remaining sheep. We think we'll find peace the day we become the smoothest, most successful, most beautiful, most desirable. We're all under Superego's command to "enjoy," and we can't do anything but try to enjoy, or rather, constantly try to enjoy.

We have no solution for human crookedness because there isn't a problem. Humans are crooked because everything is crooked. As we carve ourselves to fit within reasonable boundaries, is what we're straightening really ourselves? Or does losing the weight of our uniqueness through carving bring us comfort? What makes us believe that when all the rough edges we blame society, our parents, teachers, the state, the opposite sex, and our peers for, disappear, we'll be left with complete freedom? Why do I need to put so much effort into straightening this life, which with all its crookedness is unique and mine, to fit within reasonable boundaries?

One might say that making peace with the crookedness of everything will reconcile us with mediocrity. If that's what one desires, so be it. The modern human's problem is the inability to want what they want, and feeling compelled to want what they don't want. Even if there's no marble to be carved, there are obstacles to be demolished in front of humans. We must break down the barriers in front of our desires. The shame we feel from our crookedness must be destroyed. People should unite in crookedness, not in reasonableness. Our desires should cascade and flood together so that we can reach our authenticity.

Authenticity isn't something we discover by purging our sins and correcting ourselves. Authenticity isn't even inside us! Authenticity is something dynamic, self-regenerating, and redefining that exists in our wanting and our actions at every moment.
